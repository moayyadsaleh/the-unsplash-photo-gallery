The Unsplash Photo Gallery is a web application that fetches and displays photos from the Unsplash API  to allow for infinite scrolling. It provides a user-friendly and responsive interface to explore and view a collection of high-quality, royalty-free images from various photographers around the world.

Technical Skills Used
I used the following technologies to create this web app:

JavaScript: I used JavaScript to create the functionality of the app, including the use of asynchronous functions, event listeners, DOM manipulation, and fetching data from an API.

API Integration: I intgrated the Unsplash API to fetch a collection of photos. 

DOM Manipulation: The JavaScript code dynamically creates HTML elements, sets attributes, and appends them to the DOM. This allows the fetched photos to be displayed on the web page.

Event Handling: I employed event listeners, such as the scroll event, to trigger specific actions when certain events occur. For example, when the user scrolls near the bottom of the page, more photos are loaded.

HTML and CSS: I used  HTML and CSS to structure and style the web app.
